# plutoProj
Project for CTfNP including PLUTO generation of pi mesons from a heavy-ion fireball.

## Task list

#### Done 

 - first steps in PLUTO - generating Fireball pi+ @ 1.23A GeV

#### In progress

 - include a macro section analysing the results and generating some basic results
 - include a macro section allowing for easy customisation of fireball (Tbeam, T1, T2, f1, f2)

#### To do

 - introduce the generation of pi- and deltas from the fireball
 - introduce the delta decay to nucleons and pions
 - potential normalisation of the particle (i.e. how to ensure their distributions are produced from the same fireball?)
 - and many more...
